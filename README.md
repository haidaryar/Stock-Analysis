# Stock-Analysis

# Overview 

Conducted stock analysis for years 2017 and 2018 where total daily volume and return percentage are added to a single sheet for the client to review. Because potentially there could be more data added for analysis, the code needed refactoring to perform faster.

## Summary 

One of the advantages of refactoring a code that works perfectly fine it to make it run faster or to get it to perform better on other machines. At times refactoring code can be time consuming, that can be one of the major disadvantages. There is also a risk messing up the original code. Refactoring the orignial VBA code was time consuming and at times got confusing as well. However, I think it is worth because now this system can efficiently process and analyze data for more than just two years if necessary.

Analysis is performed faster. Please see images below.
